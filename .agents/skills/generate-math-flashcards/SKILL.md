# Generate Math Flashcards

## Purpose

Create math flashcards in this repository's custom `.note` format. Cards should be short enough that the learner can usually answer in a few sentences while still testing explanation, derivation, comparison, interpretation, assumptions, or failure cases.

## Repository Context

- Source files are `.note` files organized by topic directories.
- Import is handled by an Anki addon. Do not invent new syntax, build steps, generated artifacts.
- Follow nearby `.note` files for deck names, tags, notation, and topic granularity.

## `.note` Format

A `.note` file is plain text containing metadata directives and note records.

Metadata directives set defaults for subsequent note records. Note records contain field directives whose values become Anki model fields.

### Directives

Every directive has this shape:

```text
!name: value
```

Rules:

- The directive name starts immediately after `!` and ends at the first `:`.
- The field value begins after the `:`. Space after `:` is conventional but not required.
- A multi-line value continues until the next directive line or the note terminator line `~~~`.
- Use the exact lowercase directive names already used in this repository: `!type:`, `!deck:`, `!tags:`, `!id:`, `!front:`, `!back:`, `!related:`, and `!extra:`.

### Note Metadata

Use these metadata directives outside note records:

```text
!type: Basic Math
!deck: Math::Calculus::Limits
!tags: Math Calculus Limits Theory
```

Metadata scope:

- `!type:`, `!deck:`, and `!tags:` apply to all following notes until the same metadata directive appears again.
- Metadata may appear at the top of a file and between note records.
- Do not place file metadata inside an unfinished note record.
- Blank lines between metadata and records are allowed and used for readability.

Available note types:

- `Basic Math`: creates one front-to-back card.
- `Basic Math (and reversed card)`: creates one front-to-back card and one back-to-front card from the same note.

Use `Basic Math (and reversed card)` only when both directions are unambiguous and pedagogically useful, such as formulas, identities, named equivalences, and notation conversions. Avoid it for conceptual explanations, theorem hypotheses, one-way implications, or prompts whose reverse side would be vague.

### Note Records

A note record is a sequence of note-field directives with the standard names, such as `!front:`, `!back:`, etc.

Example minimal note:

```text
!front: A precise prompt.
!back: A direct answer.
~~~
```

Example multi-line note:

```text
!front: Derive the difference of squares identity.
!back:
\[
\begin{align*}
    a^2 - b^2 &= a^2 - ab + ab - b^2 \\
              &= a(a-b) + b(a-b) \\
              &= (a-b)(a+b).
\end{align*}
\]
!extra:
This derivation works in any commutative ring.
~~~
```

Every note must be terminated by a line containing exactly:

```text
~~~
```

Required note fields are `!front:` and `!back:`.

Optional note fields are `!related:` and `!extra:`.

The `!id:` field, if exists, contains an automatically generated stable note identifier that allows updating existing notes in Anki.

### Field Usage

- Use `!front:` for the prompt the learner must answer from memory.
- Use `!back:` for the required answer, derivation, proof sketch, or explanation.
- Use `!related:` for nearby facts, identities, or comparisons that are useful after answering but are not required for correctness.
- Use `!extra:` for assumptions, edge cases, examples, warnings, or context that would clutter the main answer.
- Keep `!back:` sufficient on its own; do not require `!related:` or `!extra:` to make the answer correct.

### Editing Rules

- Preserve existing `!id:` values exactly.
- For new notes, omit `!id:`; it is generated automatically by the note tools.
- Put `!id:` first when it is present.
- Put `!front:` before `!back:`.
- Put `!related:` and `!extra:` after `!back:` when used.
- End every note record with `~~~`.
- Start the next note or metadata directive only after the previous `~~~`.

## LaTeX and Text Style

- Use inline math as `\( ... \)` and display math as `\[ ... \]`.
- Do not introduce `$...$` in new or substantially edited text.
- Use `align*` inside display math for multi-line derivations:

```text
\[
\begin{align*}
    a^2 - b^2 &= (a - b)(a + b) \\
    a^3 - b^3 &= (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)
\end{align*}
\]
```

- Keep notation consistent within the file and with nearby topic files.
- State assumptions explicitly: domains, nonzero denominators, differentiability, invertibility, convergence conditions, matrix dimensions, branch choices, and quantifiers.
- Use Markdown bullets only when they improve readability.
- Keep answers direct and short. Avoid filler, motivational language, long exposition, and large lists.

## Note-Writing Standards

Prefer prompts that test understanding rather than recall. Good fronts often start with:

- `Why does ...`
- `Under what conditions ...`
- `What breaks if ...`
- `How are ... related?`
- `Give a geometric interpretation of ...`
- `Derive ...`
- `Compare ...`
- `Construct a counterexample to ...`
- `Explain why ...`

Design each card at the right granularity. A good card has a focused target and a `!back:` that can usually be answered in a few sentences. If the natural answer is a whole theorem statement, a long definition, a full taxonomy, or a list of many cases, split it into several cards: hypotheses, conclusion, intuition, proof idea, failure case, example, or comparison.

Use a small number of substantial notes per concept instead of many shallow variants, but do not make one card carry an entire section of material. Increase depth within a topic by moving from definitions to consequences, assumptions, derivations, and failure cases.

Avoid by default:

- trivial definition regurgitation,
- repeated notes that ask the same thing with different wording,
- purely computational drill unless computation is the point,
- dumping whole theorem definitions or long item lists into `!back:`,
- broad prompts whose answer needs more than a few sentences,
- vague fronts with no clear mathematical target,
- reverse cards where the reverse direction is ambiguous or unhelpful.

## Mathematical Rigor

- Check every formula, theorem statement, and implication before writing it.
- Do not conflate intuition with proof.
- Do not state converses unless they are true under the stated assumptions.
- Include hypotheses in the front when they are part of what the learner must recognize; otherwise include them clearly in the back or `!extra:`.
- If compressing a proof, state what is being omitted without making the shortened argument false.
- Prefer a short derivation or reason over an unsupported formula when the card is conceptual.
- Check that notation used in the front is defined or standard in the surrounding file.

## Workflow

1. Inspect nearby `.note` files for deck, tags, notation, note type, and local style.
2. Decide whether the topic needs `Basic Math` or `Basic Math (and reversed card)`.
3. Draft notes around focused conceptual targets, not just topic headings or whole theorems.
4. Verify mathematical correctness, assumptions, and notation consistency.
5. Check card granularity: each `!back:` should usually fit in a few sentences; split oversized answers into multiple notes.
6. Verify syntax: metadata outside records, required `!front:` and `!back:` fields, preserved existing `!id:` values, and one `~~~` terminator per note.

## Examples

Conceptual note:

```text
!type: Basic Math
!deck: Math::Algebra
!tags: Math Algebra Inequality

!front: Why does \( |x| \le c \), with \( c \ge 0 \), imply both an upper and a lower bound for \( x \)?
!back:
Because \( |x| \le c \) means the distance from \( x \) to \( 0 \) is at most \( c \). Equivalently,
\[ -c \le x \le c. \]
So it gives the upper bound \( x \le c \) and the lower bound \( x \ge -c \).
!extra:
The assumption \( c \ge 0 \) is necessary because \( |x| \) is always nonnegative.
~~~
```

Formula note with a justified reverse:

```text
!type: Basic Math (and reversed card)
!deck: Math::Algebra
!tags: Math Algebra Identity

!front: \[ a^2 - b^2 \]
!back: \[ (a - b)(a + b) \]
!related:
\[
\begin{align*}
    a^2 - b^2 &= (a - b)(a + b) \\
    a^2 + b^2 &= (a - ib)(a + ib)
\end{align*}
\]
~~~
```
