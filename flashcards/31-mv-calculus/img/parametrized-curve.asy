// A parametrized curve r: [a,b] -> R^3 as a mapping: the domain interval
// [a,b] sits on the left as a plain axis segment, its image curve in R^3
// sits on the right, and a dashed arrow ties a marked domain point t0 to
// its image r(t0).
//
// Manual projection throughout (no path3/size3): mixing real path3 draws
// with flat 2D content in the same picture makes Asymptote silently
// double-emit any flat fill (see generate-illustrations SKILL.md, "Flat
// fills in 3D scenes"). This scene has no fills, but stays consistent with
// the rest of the repo's 3D illustrations by routing every point through
// the same proj() helper.
